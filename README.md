# Convolution Visualization Tool

A Python tool that visualizes how convolution filters work in image processing and computer vision. The tool demonstrates the effects of different filters (horizontal edge detection, diagonal edge detection, and texture pattern detection) on sample images.

## Features
- Visual explanation of convolution operations
- Interactive display of input images, filters, and resulting feature maps
- Step-by-step calculation examples
- Detailed explanations of what each filter detects
